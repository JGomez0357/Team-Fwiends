So for 'terms and services' I wanted to add this but I thought I should get your input before changing any important code.

So for html, the code would be this:
<a href="#" onclick="openTermsService()" class="footer-link">Terms of Service</a>


For index.js we could add this:

function openTermsService() {
    const termsWindow = window.open("", "Terms Of Service", "width=700,height=800,scrollbars=yes");
    termsWindow.document.write(`
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Terms of Service</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styleMain.css"> <!-- Ensure the path is correct -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styleUpload.css"> <!-- Ensure the path is correct -->
            <style>
                body, html {
                    height: 100%;
                    margin: 0;
                    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                    background-color: #f3e4e2; /* Your color theme */
                    color: #000; /* Text color, adjust as needed */
                }
                .container {
                    padding: 20px;
                    height: calc(100% - 40px);
                    overflow-y: auto;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div class="container">
